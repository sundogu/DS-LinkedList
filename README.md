# DS-LinkedList

My implementation of LinkedList data structure. [LinkedList](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a List data structure that utilizes pointers that points to the next element in order to store a sequence of elements. Unlike Arrays, elements are not stored in a contiguous space in memory therefore cannot be indexed in the manner how Arrays can. Instead they make up for it for having faster insertion / deletion time via the Iterator.

# Time Complexity

My implementation of LinkedList has:
* List Acess: O(n)
* List Insert: O(n)
* List Insert First / Last: O(1)
* List Remove: O(n)

* Iterator Insert: O(1)
* Iterator Remove: O(1)

# Space Complexity

* O(n)
